CLASSIFICATION OF ORTHOPEDIC PATIENTS USING ML


----------------------------
ABSTRACT

The proposed system aims to assist specialists to predict the type of orthopedic disease. In 
this paper we have applied various machine learning algorithms to find out how each algorithm 
performs to detect and classify orthopedic patients. Each of the patients in the dataset is 
represented by six biomechanical attributes derived from the shape and orientation of pelvis and 
lumbar spine. We performed our operation in two stages and got an average accuracy of more than 
90 percent for most of the algorithms.

The proposed system can be used as a mini project for data mining and warehousing as well as software testing.
